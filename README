How hard is it to replace SBT?


To bootstrap
$ ./bin/build-from-scratch.rb

This outputs classes to the out directory 

$./bin/write-classpath.rb
$ . set-maker-classpath.sh
$ export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx2000m -javaagent:"<path to jrebel.jar>"
$ scala -Yrepl-sync -i Maker.scala
scala>maker.compile

That should return Right(Set(... some files ...))
Now remove the out/ directory from the classpath
$ . set-classpath.sh

You should now be good to go. cd to the starling directory, launch the repl again and build

Developing in vim is easiest. It should 'just work'. It's my 'init-scripts' repo. Pull that and run init.sh.
